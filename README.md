# Processes
  Assignment 1:
    Write a program that creates three processes to execute the following three
    programs with command line arguments:
    1. “cat /proc/cpuinfo”
    2. “echo Hello World”  
    3. “uname -a”
    and then waits for these three processes to complete before creating a process to execute
    “ls -l“ and immediately printing “Goodbye!” and exiting; not waiting for the last process to
    complete.
