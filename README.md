# Processes
  Assignment 1:
    Write a program that creates three processes to execute the following three
    programs with command line arguments:                                                     
    1. “cat /proc/cpuinfo”                                                                        
    2. “echo Hello World”                                                                   
    3. “uname -a”                                                                           
    and then waits for these three processes to complete before creating a process to execute
    “ls -l“ and immediately printing “Goodbye!” and exiting; not waiting for the last process to
    complete.
