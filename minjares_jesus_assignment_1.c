 Assignment 1:
                Write a program that creates three processes to execute the 
                following three programs with command line arguments:
                1. “cat /proc/cpuinfo”
                2. “echo Hello World”
                3. “uname -a”
                and then waits for these three processes to complete before creating a process to execute
                “ls -l“ and immediately printing “Goodbye!” and exiting; not waiting for the last process to
                complete.
